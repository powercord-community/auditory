# Auditory
Adds a little audio visualizer to the bottom left of the Discord window where the user modal is. Features a large amount of customization and captures audio from your main output device (meaning it works *anywhere* on your computer).

This screenshot doesn't show off a lot (the modal changes color and flashes slightly), so you can see a video of it working [here](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/mP75BlLd.mp4).
It's worth noting that you're able to change a lot of the options in the visualizer, including brightness if you feel like it's too distracting/bright, and the color of the visualizer.

## âš  This plugin is no longer being maintained and may stop working in the future
Although the project is no longer being maintained, this plugin should still continue working. However, it's worth noting that in the future, **some things may not work as intended, or not work at all**.
